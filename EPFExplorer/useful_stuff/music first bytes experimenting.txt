So from the following comparisons, it seems that:
The 0x08 bit indicates the presence of an instrument byte

Comparing this against the the XM specification, it suggests that:
0x04 bit indicates the presence of a volume byte
0x02 bit indicates the presence of an effect byte
0x01 bit indicates the presence of an effect data byte


===========NEVER MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!===========

Never mind! I think I've cracked it!

the C6B58C etc bit at the start... they are NOT separate control bytes. It's a run-on series of bits, and the sections of 5 bits are the actual controls!

which means... in B5, which was analysed (erroneously) above and below...


0x08 was actually the 3rd bit, the volume
0x04 was actually the 4th bit, the effect
0x01 was actually the note bit of the NEXT control

by the time the bit reader gets to (row + 0x08), it stops reading bits because obviously that's where the parameter data that we've just been reading starts

B5	first main note of EPF theme
1011 0101

8C
1000 1100	seemed to change it to a cymbal/percussive instrument

B6
1011 0110	sounds normal

B7
1011 0111	does not play a note but has glitchiness afterwards

B8
1011 1000	infinite repeating

B9
1011 1001	mini percussive note

BA
1011 1010	mini percussive note, might be a tiny bit of glitchiness? not sure

BB
1011 1011	mini percussive note, but later becomes glitchy... ... might have triggered an effect?

BC
1011 1100	plays a mini percussive note, like a shaker or something

BD
1011 1101	mini percussive note, but later becomes glitchy... might have triggered an effect?

BE
1011 1110	mini percussive note, but later becomes glitchy... might have triggered an effect?

BF
1011 1111	glitched instrument sound



95
1001 0101     infinite repeat! don't set the third byte to zero!
